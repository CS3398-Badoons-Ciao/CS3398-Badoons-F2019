## Description
Welcome to the project. We are students at Texas State University enrolled in CS3398 - Software Engineering course.
Our application is aimed for students of all grade levels who are seeking a user friendly solution for grade management.
This app will allow students to save course grade information and will simplify grade calculation using an intuitive user interface.

## Sprint 1 Project Status
Base Model is implemented, including student data, operations on that data, and data persistence via class serialization to file. The three basic scene GUI visuals have been implemented: Login, Courses Overview, and Course.  
Next Steps:
 * Jon - Finish drop down list for adding a course and GUI changes to reflect model
 * TeamMember2
 * TeamMember3
 * TeamMember4
 * TeamMember5

## Sprint 1 Goals
* User input of courses, grades, categories, and category weights and Persistant data storage - As a student I would like to create a list of my college classes and courses in those classes and save them to access later to keep my course history.
* Course data is displayed to the user - As a student, I would like to see my grades and assignments cleanly together into different categories.
* Intuitive grade calculation - As a student, I would like a program that calculates various averages for my classes in an easy to use way.
