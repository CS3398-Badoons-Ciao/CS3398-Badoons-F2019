// Single-Responsibility: Robot class will not be changed for more than one reason (to change work() - in this example.
// Open-Closed: Open to change by deriving from Robot and overriding work(), without modification.
// Interface Segregation: The original IWorker interface was split to accomodate this Robot class,
//                        as a Robot does not need to eat(). Thus, RWorker interface was segregated.
