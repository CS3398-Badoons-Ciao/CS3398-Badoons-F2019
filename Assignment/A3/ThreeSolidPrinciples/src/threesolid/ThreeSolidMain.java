/*This is the main file where the program runs from
* All the extra classes and interfaces have been removed and separated into their files to allow multi able users to work on the program at the same time.
* This has been done to implement the following principle...
*  -Open Closed principle: This principle does not apply as nothing would be extending the main. To see this Principle in action refer to the interface classes.
*  -Single Responsibility: By separating these files one user can reasonably manage the one class thus making the user responsible for that program alone. This all then follows this principle.
*  -Interface segregation: This principle was not used in the main class because the main does not implement any interfaces, to see this in action refer to the interface class in IWorker.java
